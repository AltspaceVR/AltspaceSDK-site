If you’ve been attending the semi-weekly SDK Developer Meetup events, you may have seen a wonderful little app involving
remote-controlled planes, claw machines, and pumpkins. It was created by the one and only smsithlord, who wrote an
interesting article about the design process. If you have a taste for game design, it’s worth a read. Check it out from
