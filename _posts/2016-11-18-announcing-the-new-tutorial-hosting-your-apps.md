Hello developers!

Today, we at AltspaceVR are excited to present a new tutorial for those developers that are just getting started with
our SDKs:

[Hosting your AltspaceVR Apps](/hosting-your-apps/)

This tutorial walks you through the process of using JS Bin to do live coding, or using GitHub Pages to host more
complete apps. As always, let us know what you think in the comments below, or on the offical Slack channels.

Be excellent to each other!
