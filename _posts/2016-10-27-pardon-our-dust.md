Hi everyone, itâ€™s been a while!

As of this post, we have officially begun blowing the dust off of this site (developer.altvr.com), and revitalizing it
with new and relevant content for you, our AltspaceVR developer community. Expect things to be changing around for the
next few weeks, but at the end of it I expect we will have a more functional and friendly site for beginners and
veterans alike. Stay tuned!
