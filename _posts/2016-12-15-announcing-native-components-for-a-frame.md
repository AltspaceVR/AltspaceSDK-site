title: Announcing Native Components for A-Frame!
---


Hello everyone!

Today, we have something very exciting to announce: the public beta of the new native playground, and a load of new
A-Frame SDK features!

<figure><img src="/assets/images/playground.png" /></figure>

As of today, AltspaceVR SDK developers can use A-Frame components to manipulate a variety of native AltspaceVR
resources, including architectural building blocks, particle effects, physically blocking colliders, positional sounds,
and more! Additionally, we’ve ported over our Firebase synchronization functionality from the Three.js SDK. These
represent a huge jump in the power available to our developers, and we are very excited to see what you produce. For a
complete description of the new features available, you should check out the updated A-Frame documentation, and the
Native Components FAQ.

Alongside the new SDK features, we are launching a new developer-only activity: the SDK Playground. During the beta
test, this is the only space that the native resources work in. Once the feature set stabilizes, we look forward to
opening up native resources to apps in all spaces.

You’ve been asking for these features, and we listened! Thanks to all the SDK developers for making AltspaceVR such a
fun and interesting place to be!
