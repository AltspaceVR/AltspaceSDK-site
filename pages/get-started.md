Welcome to the AltspaceVR developer forums. There are multiple ways to add content to AltspaceVR. Here is an overview for them:

## Mixed Reality Extension (MRE) SDK
The MRE SDK is the new SDK for building AltspaceVR extensions using Node.JS. To get started:
1.	Install AltspaceVR (from Steam or Oculus Store), create an AltspaceVR account, and familiarize yourself with the app.
2.	Install Git command line tools ([install instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
3.	Go to the [MRE SDK Samples repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk-samples), and follow the step-by-step instructions to build and run a sample

You can also
* Join the [MRE SDK Discord Community](https://discord.gg/xyBcQec) to chat with other MRE developers.
* Watch the [Building Tic-Tac-Toe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHrdK9JSXI)
* Learn how to edit and build MREs with [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk#using-visual-studio-code)
* Browse the [Hello World](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk-samples/tree/master/samples/hello-world) source code
* Attend our [weekly developer meetups in AltspaceVR](https://account.altvr.com/channels/sdk)

## World Editor
Inside AltspaceVR, you can use our built-in world editor in your home space. This is the easiest way to start modifying your space. Simply click the World Editor button, bottom right, when you are in your home space. See our [Get Started With World Building help page](https://help.altvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015271113-How-do-I-get-started-world-building-). With the World Editor, you can place 3d objects, teleporters and extensions (MREs), and change the world skybox.

If you join the [Early Access program](https://help.altvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015270793-What-is-the-Early-Access-Program-), you will also be able to create additional worlds on the [AltspaceVR My Worlds page](https://account.altvr.com/worlds/my).

## Unity Uploader
We offer a Unity uploader for both worlds and custom kits. This feature is very early in development. To learn more, please join the [World Builders Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Kp59Frb) to chat, or read about it on the [World Building help pages](https://help.altvr.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002939973-World-Building).

If you have legacy Unity 2018 kits or templates to update to Unity 2019.2, check out the [Upgrade Guide](upgrade-2019-2.md).

## Integrating the MRE SDK into your own app
If you have made your own app or game in Unity3D, and want to run MREs inside your app, you should look at the [MRE Unity Client Library](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-unity) repository
