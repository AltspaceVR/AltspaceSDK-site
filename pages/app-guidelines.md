Brainstorming ideas for an app? Think about these pointers when you're shaping your concept.

* Keep it __simple__! Build something that you can release soon, so that our new influx of users can try it.
* Build your app so that a small group (ideally for 2-6 people) can use it. It should take advantage of Altspace's __social__ aspect and it should be __fun__!
* Ideally the app should have __repeated play__ value or some sort of loop mechanic. Your app might be listed on our Home page, so it should be something that people want to come back to and play again.
* Make the app __easy__ to use or learn first time. Overly complicated instructions or lengthy learning periods are a barrier for new, casual users. It shouldn't need someone to be there attend to it or explain it.
* Do something __novel__! Use your app to explore the frontiers of socializing in VR, make full use of our API and experiment to figure out what works best in Altspace.
* The app should work well in the __Gear VR__. Don't assume a keyboard, mouse, Leap Motion or gamepad. The cursor in the Gear is locked to the user's head. You can also use swipe events for the touchpad. Be aware of performance limitations and neck fatigue.
* The app __doesn't necessarily have to be a game__. Useful, productive, artistic or creative apps can be compelling as well.
* Use __whatever tool works best__. Remember that you can also use the 2D displays (in addition to the 3D enclosures) to build apps with usual web dev technologies (including your own hosted server-side tech). 2D displays still have access to Altspace APIs.
* Add a __reset button__ if you can, in case things go wrong or if a user wants to start from scratch.
* If your app needs __instructions__, add an instruction screen for text or diagrams.
* Ideally has a __single-player mode__, but make sure it's obvious if more players are required.
* Consider building an app that has a __reusable core__ that you can repurpose. For example, the drawing canvas in our Sketchy Quiz app can be used for a whiteboard app or a free-form drawing app.
